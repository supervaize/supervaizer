# React Framework Skills

## React Patterns

### Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks

### State Management
- Use useState for local state
- Use Context for shared state
- Consider Redux for complex state

### Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Use useMemo/useCallback appropriately
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
