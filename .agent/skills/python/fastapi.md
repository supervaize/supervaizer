# FastAPI Framework Skills

## FastAPI Patterns

### Routes
- Use dependency injection for shared logic
- Use Pydantic models for validation
- Version APIs in path or header

### Async
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Use background tasks for long operations
- Be careful with database connections

### Documentation
- FastAPI auto-generates OpenAPI docs
- Add descriptions to routes and models
- Include examples in schemas
