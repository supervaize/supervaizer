# Testing Skills

## Testing Principles

### Coverage
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Focus on critical paths
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Types
- Unit tests: Fast, isolated, test individual functions
- Integration tests: Test component interactions
- E2E tests: Test complete user workflows

### Best Practices
- Write tests before fixing bugs (TDD when possible)
- Keep tests independent and repeatable
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
